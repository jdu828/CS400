	There was once a young lion cub in the wild amazon rainforest. He had no name, no family, and no understanding of who or where he was. All he knew were the maze of trees around him, the river that wrapped around his home, and the prey he hunted. He was always alone, for he was the only lion in the wild. Insects scattered when they heard him rumble down the path, ready to kill at a moments notice. The other predators watched him hunt, wary of making sudden movements. They had never seen anything like him.
	When he was 6, there was another lion came to his territory. The new lion was challenging him in this rainforest, determined to find out who is a better predator. The lion accepted the challenge and drove him out of his territory.}
	The lion had beat his challenger and continued to be the only lion in his territory for years to come.  No other lion ever thought to challenge him and his 
territory remained his for years to come.
